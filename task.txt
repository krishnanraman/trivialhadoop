Task: Given n employees, with an employee structure like so -
 
case class Employee(id:Long, salary:Double, year:Short, name:String)
 
a. Use a mapper to give each employee an increment based on his year & salary
  // every employee gets an increment
  // $1 for each day since the year they joined the company + 0.1% of their existing salary
  // 10% taxes, so 0.9 * above
  
b. Use a filter to separate odd & even employees into 2 buckets, by the employee id
c. Use a reducer to sum the employee increments in each bucket
 
Do this task in both DScalding & TrivialHadoop.
Confirm that the results agree.
Benchmark based on number of employees.
